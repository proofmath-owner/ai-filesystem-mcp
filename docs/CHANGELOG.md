# AI FileSystem MCP - Change Log

## Version 2.1.0 - 2025-01-28 - Command Pattern Refactoring Complete ðŸŽ‰

### Major Architecture Changes

#### Command Pattern Migration (100% Complete)
- Successfully migrated all 39 commands from monolithic switch statement to Command Pattern
- Completed migration of final 7 Metadata Commands:
  - `analyze_project`
  - `get_file_metadata`
  - `get_directory_tree`
  - `compare_files`
  - `find_duplicate_files`
  - `create_symlink`
  - `diff_files`

### Improvements
- **Code Organization**: Commands now organized by category (file, search, git, security, etc.)
- **Maintainability**: Each command is now a self-contained class with clear responsibilities
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type checking with dedicated input validation
- **Extensibility**: Adding new commands is now as simple as creating a new Command class
- **Testing**: Easier unit testing with isolated command implementations

### Technical Details
- Reduced main index.ts from 700+ lines to modular architecture
- Created CommandRegistry for centralized command management
- Implemented gradual migration strategy with LegacyCommands support
- Added comprehensive validation helpers in base Command class

### Next Steps (Phase 2 & 3)
- Decompose FileSystemManager (31KB) into service modules
- Implement Generic Command types for better type inference
- Add Zod/io-ts for runtime type validation
- Performance optimizations with streaming and worker threads
