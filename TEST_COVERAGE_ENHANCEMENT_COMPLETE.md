## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Mock Strategy
```typescript
// Service Layer Mocking
const mockService = {
  method1: jest.fn(),
  method2: jest.fn(),
  initialize: jest.fn(),
  dispose: jest.fn(),
} as jest.Mocked<ServiceType>;

// File System Mocking
jest.mock('fs/promises');
const mockedFs = fs as jest.Mocked<typeof fs>;

// Dependency Injection Testing
container.register('serviceName', mockService);
```

### Test Configuration
```typescript
// Jest Configuration (jest.config.simple.js)
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  testMatch: ['**/src/tests/unit/**/*.test.ts'],
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.ts',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
    '!src/**/index.ts',
    '!src/**/*.test.ts',
    '!src/types/**',
    '!src/tests/**'
  ],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 75,
      functions: 75,
      lines: 75,
      statements: 75
    }
  }
};
